Working with Objects
====================

Using objects you can add a great deal of information to your map for
use in your game. They can replace tedious alternatives like hardcoding
coordinates (like spawn points) in your source code or maintaining
additional data files for storing gameplay elements. With the addition
of *tile objects*, they also became useful for graphical purposes and
can in some cases replace tile layers entirely, as demonstrated by the
"Sticker Knight" example shipping with Tiled.

To start using objects, add an :ref:`Object Layer <object-layer-introduction>`
to your map.

Placement Tools
---------------

Each type of object has its own placement tool.

.. raw:: html

   <div class="new new-prev">Since Tiled 1.2</div>

A preview is shown of the object you're about to place when you hover
over the map. While placing an object, you can press ``Escape`` or
right-click to cancel placement of the object. Press ``Escape`` again
to switch to the :ref:`select-objects-tool` tool.

.. _insert-rectangle-tool:

Insert Rectangle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shortcut: ``R``

The rectangle was the first type of object supported by Tiled, which is why
objects are rectangles by default in the :doc:`/reference/tmx-map-format`. They
are useful for marking rectangular areas and assigning custom properties to
them. They are also often used for specifying collision boxes.

Place a rectangle by clicking-and-dragging in any direction. Holding
``Shift`` makes it square and holding ``Ctrl`` snaps its size to the
tile size.

If the rectangle is empty (width and height are both 0), it is rendered
as a small square around its position. This is mainly to keep it visible
and selectable.

.. raw:: html

   <div class="new new-prev">Since Tiled 1.1</div>

.. _insert-point-tool:

Insert Point
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shortcut: ``I``

Points are the simplest objects you can place on a map. They only represent a
location, and cannot be resized or rotated. Simply click on the map to position
a point object.

.. _insert-ellipse-tool:

Insert Ellipse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shortcut: ``C``

Ellipses work the same way as `rectangles <#insert-rectangle>`__, except
that they are rendered as an ellipse. Useful for when your area or
collision shape needs to represent a circle or ellipse.

.. _insert-polygon-tool:

Insert Polygon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shortcut: ``P``

Polygons are the most flexible way of defining the shape of an area.
They are most commonly used for defining collision shapes.

When placing a polygon, the first click determines the location of the
object as well as the location of the first point of the polygon.
Subsequent clicks are used to add additional points to the polygon.
Polygons needs to have at least three points. Click the first point
again to finish creating the polygon. You can press ``Escape`` to cancel
the creation of the polygon.

When you want to change a polygon after it has been placed, you need to
use the :ref:`edit-polygons-tool` tool.

Polylines
^^^^^^^^^

Polylines are created by not closing a polygon. Right-click or press Enter
while creating a polygon to finish it as a polyline.

Polylines are rendered as a line and require only two points. While they
can represent collision walls, they are also often used to represent
paths to be followed.

.. raw:: html

   <div class="new new-prev">Since Tiled 1.2</div>

You can extend an existing polyline at either end when it is selected,
by clicking on the displayed dots. It is also possible to finish the
polyline by connecting it to either end of another existing polyline
object. The other polyline object needs to be selected as well, since
the interactive dots only show on selected polylines.

The :ref:`edit-polygons-tool` tool is used to edit polylines as well.

.. _insert-tile-tool:

Insert Tile
~~~~~~~~~~~

Shortcut: ``T``

Tiles can be inserted as objects to have full flexibility in placing,
scaling and rotating the tile image on your map. Like all objects, tile
objects can also have custom properties associated with them. This makes
them useful for placement of recognizable interactive objects that need
special information, like a chest with defined contents or an NPC with
defined script.

To place a tile object, first select the tile you want to place in the
Tilesets view. Then use the Left mouse button on the map to start
placing the object, move to position it based on the preview and release
to finish placing the object.

.. raw:: html

   <div class="new new-prev">Since Tiled 1.0</div>

To change the tile used by existing tile objects, select all the objects
you want to change using the :ref:`select-objects-tool` tool and then
right-click on a tile in the Tilesets view, and choose *Replace Tile of
Selected Objects*.

.. raw:: html

   <div class="new new-prev">Since Tiled 1.1</div>

.. _insert-template-tool:

Insert Template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shortcut: ``V``

Can be used to quickly insert multiple instances of the template
selected in the Templates view. See :ref:`creating-template-instances`.

.. _insert-text-tool:

Insert Text
~~~~~~~~~~~

Shortcut: ``X``

Text objects can be used to add arbitrary multi-line text to your maps.
You can configure various font properties and the wrapping / clipping
area, making them useful for both quick notes as well as text used in
the game.

.. _select-objects-tool:

Select Objects
--------------

Shortcut: ``S``

When you're not inserting new objects, you're generally using the Select
Objects tool. It packs a lot of functionality, which is outlined below.

Selecting and Deselecting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can select objects by clicking them or by dragging a rectangular
lasso, selecting any object that intersect with its area. By holding
``Shift`` or ``Ctrl`` while clicking, you can add/remove single objects
to/from the selection. Press ``Escape`` to deselect all objects.

When pressing and dragging on an object, this object is selected and
moved. When this prevents you from starting a rectangular selection, you
can hold ``Shift`` to force the selection rectangle.

.. raw:: html

   <div class="new new-prev">Since Tiled 1.0</div>

By default you interact with the top-most object. When you need to
select an object below another object, first select the higher object
and then hold ``Alt`` while clicking at the same location to select
lower objects. You can also hold ``Alt`` while opening the context menu
to get a list of all objects at the clicked location, so you may
directly select the desired object.

.. raw:: html

   <div class="new new-prev">Since Tiled 1.2</div>

You can quickly switch to the :ref:`edit-polygons-tool` tool by
double-clicking on the polygon or polyline you want to edit.

Moving
~~~~~~

You can simply drag any single object, or drag already selected objects
by dragging any one of them. Hold ``Ctrl`` to toggle snapping to the
tile grid.

Hold ``Alt`` to force a move operation on the currently selected
objects, regardless of where you click on the map. This is useful when
the selected objects are small or covered by other objects.

The selected objects can also be moved with the arrow keys. By default
this moves the objects pixel by pixel. Hold ``Shift`` while using the
arrow keys to move the objects by distance of one tile.

Resizing
~~~~~~~~

You can use the resize handles to resize one or more selected objects.
Hold ``Ctrl`` to keep the aspect ratio of the object and/or ``Shift`` to
place the resize origin in the center.

Note that you can only change width and height independently when
resizing a single object. When having multiple objects selected, the
aspect ratio is constant because there would be no way to make that work
for rotated objects without full support for transformations.

Rotating
~~~~~~~~

To rotate, click any selected object to change the resize handles into
rotation handles. Before rotating, you can drag the rotation origin to
another position if necessary. Hold ``Shift`` to rotate in 15-degree
increments. Click any selected object again to go back to resize mode.

You can also rotate the selected objects in 90-degree steps by pressing
``Z`` or ``Shift + Z``.

Changing Stacking Order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the active :ref:`Object Layer <object-layer-introduction>` has its Drawing
Order property set to Manual (the default is Top Down), you can control
the stacking order of the selected objects within their object layer
using the following keys:

-  ``PgUp`` - Raise selected objects
-  ``PgDown`` - Lower selected objects
-  ``Home`` - Move selected objects to Top
-  ``End`` - Move selected objects to Bottom

You can also find these actions in the context menu. When you have
multiple Object Layers, the context menu also contains actions to move
the selected objects to another layer.

Flipping Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can flip the selected objects horizontally by pressing ``X`` or
vertically by pressing ``Y``. For tile objects, this also flips their
images.

.. _edit-polygons-tool:

Edit Polygons
-------------

Shortcut: ``E``

Polygons and polylines have their own editing needs and as such are
covered by a separate tool, which allows selecting and moving around
their nodes. You can select and move the nodes of multiple polygons at
the same time. Click a segment to select the nodes at both ends. Press
``Escape`` to deselect all nodes, or to switch back to the
:ref:`select-objects-tool` tool.

Nodes can be deleted by selecting them and choosing "Delete Nodes" from
the context menu. The ``Delete`` key can also be used to delete the
selected nodes, or the selected objects if no nodes are selected.

When you have selected multiple consecutive nodes of the same polygon,
you can join them together by choosing "Join Nodes" from the context
menu. You can also split the segments in between the nodes by choosing
"Split Segments". Alternatively, you can simply double-click a segment
to split it at that location.

You can also delete a segment when two consecutive nodes are
selected in a polygon by choosing "Delete Segment" in the context menu.
This will convert a polygon into a polyline, or turn one polyline
object in two polyline objects.

.. raw:: html

   <div class="new new-prev">Since Tiled 1.2</div>

It is possible to extend a polyline at either end, either by
right-clicking those nodes and choosing "Extend Polyline", or by
switching to the :ref:`insert-polygon-tool` tool and clicking on either
end of an already selected polylines.


.. topic:: Future Extensions
   :class: future

   Here are some ideas about improvements that could be made to the above
   tools:

   -  Some improvements could still be made to the support for editing
      polygons and polylines, like allowing to rotate and scale the
      selected nodes (`#1487 <https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/issues/1487>`__).

   -  The tools could put short usage instructions in the status bar,
      to help new users without requiring them to carefully read the
      manual (`#1855 <https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/issues/1855>`__).

   If you like any of these plans, please help me getting around to it
   faster by `becoming a patron <https://www.patreon.com/bjorn>`__. The
   more support I receive the more time I can afford to spend improving
   Tiled!
